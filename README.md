# CAS-AML-M3

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks, each demonstrating different machine learning techniques using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The notebooks are designed for CAS AML Module 3, specifically focusing on image processing and deep learning.


1. CIFARdenoisev2.ipynb
   
Objective: Demonstrates image denoising using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Key Features:
- Implements an autoencoder architecture.
- Uses the CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing.
- Includes preprocessing steps like normalizing and adding noise to images.
- Visualizes original, noisy, and denoised images for comparison.
- Evaluates the model using metrics like PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).


2. CIFARv2.ipynb

Objective: Focuses on image classification using a deep learning approach.

Key Features:

- Utilizes various CNN architectures to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Includes detailed data preprocessing and augmentation steps.
- Demonstrates model building, training, and evaluation processes.
- Visualizes training results including accuracy and loss plots.
- Discusses model performance and potential areas for improvement.


3. VAE CIFAR10.ipynb
   
Objective: Showcases the creation and training of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for image generation.

Key Features:

- Explains the structure and function of VAEs.
- Uses the CIFAR-10 dataset for training the VAE.
- Demonstrates image reconstruction and generation from the latent space.
- Includes visualization of original, reconstructed, and randomly generated images.
- Discusses latent space representations and their significance.
